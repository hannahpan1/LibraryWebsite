			     <ul>
				    	<li><h4><b>Test don’t recognize<b></h4>
							<p>Recognition is often mistaken for recalling when revising. <br> “Recognition is a much easier task – all you have to do is look at something in your environment and generate the correct feeling of familiarity (like when you look at your revision notes and think “I’m sick of looking at these”) But in your exam you don’t get marks for things being familiar, you get marks for recalling relevant information and using it to answer the question.”</p>
            	</li>

			  			<li><h4><b>Space out studying time<b></h4>
              	<p>Cramming results in more fragile memories, while spacing out studying can aid in recalling information better.</p>
              </li>

 			  			<li><h4><b>Effort, not flow<b></h4>
               	<p>Revision is not about reassuring yourself about what you do know, but instead finding out what you don’t. <br> “it’s far more satisfying to revise what we know, since this triggers a rewarding sense of familiarity, rather than focus on our weaknesses. Ericsson has gone so far as to suggest that deliberate practice is the opposite of the flow state, when practice is most enjoyable.”</p>
              </li>

  			  		<li><h4><b>Practice output not input<b></h4>
                	<p>It may be tempting to relearn the material, but fundamentally you are being marked on your answers. It is important as a result to practice answering questions.</p>
              </li>

   			  		<li><h4><b>Learn what works for you<b></h4>
                 	<p>Throughout your studies, it is key to understand how you study best whether that be alone, together, night or day. It may help to find out if you are a visual, auditory or kinesthetic learner and then adapt that to your revision. For instance, if you are an auditory learner perhaps reading your notes out loud could help or studying in a quiet environment to avoid distractions.</p>
              </li>

    			  	<li><h4><b>Eliminate distractions<b></h4>
                  	<p>Keep all unexpected devices that may distract you away. Multitasking (aka checking social media etc. while you're studying) overall increases the amount of time to learn the material and decreases the quality of learning.</p>
              </li>
          </ul>

      <h3 style="color:#3399ff"><b> Sleep</b></h3>
         <p> Sleep is critical for both mental and physical health, but also for studying. “Recent studies have shown that adequate sleep is essential to feeling awake and alert, maintaining good health and working at peak performance. After two weeks of sleeping six hours or less a night, students feel as bad and perform as poorly as someone who has gone without sleep for 48 hours..” It is recommended that adolescents get 8-10 hours of sleep each night.</p>
				 <ul>
						<li><h4><b>Follow a regular sleep schedule<b></h4>
							<p>Yes even on weekends!</p>
						</li>

						<li><h4><b>Stop looking at any screens an hour before you sleep<b></h4>
							<p>“Artificial light exposure between dusk and the time we go to bed suppresses release of the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin, enhances alertness and shifts circadian rhythms to a later hour – making it more difficult to fall asleep,” said Dr. Charles Czeisler, from Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital”</p>
						</li>

						<li><h4><b>Stay out of the bed. Don’t study, read or watch TV on your bed. Only use your bed for sleeping.<b></h4>
							<p>“When you spend a lot of time in bed awake and frustrated, your body may start to link bed with being awake and frustrated. Chronic insomnia develops as a result of this negative association.”</p>
						</li>

						<li><h4><b>Wind down before sleeping<b></h4>
								<p>Find something relaxing to do away from cellphones and laptops 15-30min before bed.</p>
						</li>

						<li><h4><b>Exercise during the day<b></h4>
								<p>“However, we do know that moderate aerobic exercise increases the amount of slow wave sleep you get. Slow wave sleep refers to deep sleep, where the brain and body have a chance to rejuvenate. Exercise can also help to stabilize your mood and decompress the mind, 'a cognitive process that is important for naturally transitioning to sleep,' says Gamaldo.”</p>
						</li>

						<li><h4><b>Avoid eating large meals<b></h4>
									<p>“Indigestion can also make it harder to stay asleep, Rajkumar Dasgupta, M.D., a clinician and associate professor at Keck Medicine of USC’s division of pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine, says. Both issues can cause small arousals that you might not remember, but can prevent you from getting into deeper phases of sleep and leaving you under-rested and groggy in the morning...”</p>
						</li>
				</ul>

      <h3 style="color:#3399ff"><b>Stress Management</b></h3>
            <p> Being a student can be stressful especially when it comes to academic demand. Below are some tips to help manage stress:</p>
						<ul>
	 						<li><h4><b>Exercise and get some fresh air<b></h4>
	 							<p>“Regular exercise boosts brain health, and a fit brain is generally able to learn, think and remember better. But a few recent studies offer an additional exercise-related tip: time your workouts for just after a study session, and you might better retain the information you just learned.”</p>
	 						</li>

	 						<li><h4><b>Manage your time<b></h4>
	 							<p>Designate times to both relax and study, ensuring that you do have some down time.</p>
	 						</li>

	 						<li><h4><b>Take one step at a time<b></h4>
	 							<p>It’s easy to get overwhelmed with school work and deadlines. By making a list you can sort your time more efficiently.</p>
	 						</li>

	 						<li><h4><b>Take a break!<b></h4>
	 								<p>Do something you enjoy whether it be sports, art, music etc.</p>
	 						</li>

	 						<li><h4><b>Finally, stop procrastinating (really)<b></h4>
	 								<p>Most people procrastinate because they dread the task they have to complete. By getting it over sooner, you’ll be a lot less stressed out by the end!</p>
	 						</li>
	 				</ul>

					<br><br>

			<h3 style="color:#3399ff"><b> Time Management</b></h3>
						 <p> As mentioned before, time management is critical for not only student success but also stress management. Here are some tips to help:</p>
						 <ul>
								<li><h4><b>Keep a calendar or planner<b></h4>
									<p>Keeping track of deadlines, exams and projects can be difficult at times. By having an agenda, it helps keep the guesswork out of it. There’s no need to remember all those dates, just check your planner! </p>
								</li>

								<li><h4><b>Prioritize <b></h4>
									<p>This one’s pretty simple, finish more important/incoming deadlines first. Don’t leave the hardest task till the end of the day, or else you risk potentially becoming overwhelmed and stressed out.</p>
								</li>

								<li><h4><b>Learn how to say no<b></h4>
									<p>As a student, it may be tempting to join extracurriculars, clubs, student council etc., but by over committing yourself you can become tired and overworked. This may lead you to be unable to commit to the things you really want to do in the future. </p>
								</li>
						</ul>
